            I love 0 to 1 design, as it's where I can leverage my skillset in
            design, research, and code (I made this website!) and have worked
            for six different companies ranging in size and mission. Beyond
            work, I enjoy bringing people together to drive change. At
            <a href="https://www.cornellh4i.org/"> Hack4Impact</a>, I founded
            the design team and led{" "}

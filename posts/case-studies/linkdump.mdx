### About the Project

Link Dump is an ephemeral canvas I created over the course of weekends and nights between the spring and summer of 2025. I implemented abilities for users to paste links, files and import Are.na channels in which they, along with the canvas, would age with time.

At the end of the time, the user would be given the choice to export it as a CSV to save it locally or save anew. Along with locally storing pasted files in the browser, I implemented a collaborative and cross-device board mode with Firebase with a shareable link.

Although I used Claude and Cursor to help me implement features, I designed the visual, brand, and interaction myself utilizing Figma and Framer.

### Design details

Designing and building a product myself is much different than just doing it in Figma. I ran into numerous issues, for example, because I am using an external package to create a zoomable canvas, there is a bug I'm still working through regarding the edit and select interactions for specific cards where the width resizes. Additionally, a feature I wanted to add was grouping, especially as it became difficult to sort a large number of cards spatially, however I ran into numerous issues trying to integrate that into my spaghetti code.

Another development was initially I relied on simple modals for onboarding, however upon testing realized that most users won't try and read through or input all of it.

As a result, I changed my concept to include a new onboarding process that launched you directly into the experience.

<Caption>Note: The next iteration of this will be fixing the visual design of the cards to convey more scannable information</Caption>

I allowed progressive disclosure of new features, such as changing the time or date and allowing users to convert their board into a collaborative one rather than having them choose which mode from the start.

I would say one of the biggest difficulties with this project was most of my time spent trying to debug and wrangle code than actually designing. As a result, I would become laser focused on testing functionality rather than exploring the design widely from the start.

### Why did I build this? Conceptual underpinnings

For more background on the inspiration and motivation behind this project: I saw principles in the cycles of creation and decay shared across both natural cycles and creative cycles, and saw an opportunity to join the two. As a serial digital hoarder, I save so much - screenshots in-between photos, thousand item are.na channels, a notes app of one-liners: I'm holding onto so much it falls through my hands. We collect as a form of noticing and remembering- perhaps it colors a perspective or recalls a feeling buried inside us. We collect with the intent of synthesizing and creating- an ever running to do list. But if we don't act, creativity will linger at the door and disappear.

### Acknowledgements

I'm grateful to have been able to spend some time at the [Strange Residency](https://thestrange.foundation/residencies-retreats) retreat to work on this as well as exhibit this at Bring Your Own Beamer at the Gray Area. The feedback I received at both has helped shape the future of the project.

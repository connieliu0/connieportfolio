Note: because I am using an external package to create a zoomable canvas, there is a bug I'm still working through regarding the edit and select interactions for specific cards where the width resizes.

### About the Project

Link Dump is an ephemeral canvas I created over the course of weekends and nights between March and April. I implemented abilities for users to paste links, files and import Are.na channels in which they, along with the canvas, would age with time.

At the end of the time, the user would be given the choice to export it as a CSV to save it locally or save anew. Along with locally storing pasted files in the browser, I implemented a collaborative and cross-device board mode with Firebase with a shareable link.

Although I used Claude and Cursor to help me implement features, I designed the visual, brand, and interaction myself utilizing Figma and Framer.

### Conceptual Underpinnings

For more background on the inspiration and motivation behind this project: I saw principles in the cycles of creation and decay shared across both natural cycles and creative cycles, and saw an opportunity to join the two. As a serial digital hoarder, I save so much - screenshots in-between photos, thousand item are.na channels, a notes app of one-liners: I'm holding onto so much it falls through my hands. We collect as a form of noticing and remembering- perhaps it colors a perspective or recalls a feeling buried inside us. We collect with the intent of synthesizing and creating- an ever running to do list. But if we don't act, creativity will linger at the door and disappear.

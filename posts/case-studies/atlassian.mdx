## 📈 Atlassian Analytics 

Our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) is an add on for enterprise customers and consists of dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. Some features I designed:

## 🎯 Atlassian Atlas Goals 
Atlas Goals is a consumer-facing product for teams of all sizes to track their OKRs. While I can't say too much as this project has not been released yet, I am working on permissions to unblock adoption and prototyping several functional AI-enabled setup vision states using Cursor and v0.

## 👤 Atlassian Admin Experience

Admin.atlassian.com is the hub for thousands of organizations to manager their users and product instances. I designed:
<Row content1="<h3>A search experience and vision for thousands of administrators 🔍</h3><em><h4><a href='https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Atlassian-Platform-articles/Introducing-Atlassian-Administration-Search-Find-Settings-Faster/ba-p/2778798'>Announcement</a></h4></em><p>Led research and design for feature that doubled the rate of successful searches.</p>"

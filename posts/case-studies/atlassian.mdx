## üìà Atlassian Analytics 

Our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) is an add on for enterprise customers and consists of dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. Some features I designed: 
<Row content1="<h3>AI-gen SQLite Custom Formulas ‚ú®</h3><em><h4><a href='https://connieliu.work/customformula'>Case study</a> (password in resume!)</h4></em><p>Led to 11% increase in accuracy, AI-generated represented 25% of all custom formulas created, reduced support requests by 91% and increased overall custom formula creation by 30%.</p>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/AI_formula.gif' />"
/>

<Row content1="<h3>Custom templates üìä </h3> <em><h4>Transferring case study in progress, please contact me for more info!</h4></em><p>Making it easier to reuse company-specific dashboards to increase overall dashboard MAU and increase enterprise product adoption.</p>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/customtemp.png' />"
/>

<Row content1="<h3>Generative AI Research üî¨ </h3><p>Led exploratory user research on receptions to Chart Insights and Dashboard Insights (concept) which received recognition from Head of Product and impacted the Rovo AI team's roadmap.</p>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/genai.png' />"
/>

### Vibe-coding and prototyping

I wrote the companies first-ever vibecoding tutorial (300+ views) receiving recognition from the VP of AI design and impacting many senior and lead designers to learn and incorporate it into their process. 

The benefits of vibecoded prototypes I explored ranged from dynamic data control via a JSON to actually connecting to the OpenAI API to experiment with LLMs.

I am also doing complex interaction design prototyping for our AI button currently, please reach out to me if you're interested in learning more.

## üéØ Atlassian Atlas Goals 
Atlas Goals is a consumer-facing product for teams of all sizes to track their OKRs. While I can't say too much as this project has not been released yet, I am working on permissions to unblock adoption and prototyping several functional AI-enabled setup vision states using Cursor and v0.
<br />
## üë§ Atlassian Admin Experience

Admin.atlassian.com is the hub for thousands of organizations to manager their users and product instances. I designed:
<Row content1="<h3>A search experience and vision for thousands of administrators üîç</h3><em><h4><a href='https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Atlassian-Platform-articles/Introducing-Atlassian-Administration-Search-Find-Settings-Faster/ba-p/2778798'>Announcement</a></h4></em><p>Led research and design for feature that doubled the rate of successful searches to 44%.</p>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/search.gif'  autoplay loop />"
/>
<br />
<Row content1="<h3>Designing complex flows to unblock datacenter to cloud migration ‚òÅÔ∏è</h3><p>End to end project touching three different product surfaces spanning two other teams and timezones to solve a key blocker for enterprise companies.</p>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/flow.png' />"
/>

### Design system patterns for empty states, table actions, admin emails, illustrations and object linkers üñäÔ∏è
Integrating patterns across 20 plus screens, 10 use cases, and two products respectively.

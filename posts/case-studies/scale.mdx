While at Scale, a fast-pace late-stage startup, I was on three product teams under four different product managers where I worked on **11 projects** from 0-1 features to design systems over 12 weeks. I had a range of duties in each cross-functional team, from working with product managers to plan user research to handing off designs to engineers and ensuring designs were implemented correctly.

Highlights are projects 3 and 5 but make sure to read the Rapid and Studio context slides first.

**Impact Metrics**: My projects on Rapid led to a 70.5% increase in number of template self-serve projects, and a 10% increase in self-serve deployment. I was also offered a full-time role before it was cut as the company faced a 20% layoff.

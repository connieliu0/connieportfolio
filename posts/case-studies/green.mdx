Sustainability tracking is an overdone idea - and I wanted to avoid the key pitfalls I saw in EarthHero, Joro, and Capture:

1. Too much energy on quantifying the carbon footprint of existing - instead of measuring the current harm, **instead I wanted to focus on actionable goals and clear education towards a generalist sustainable lifestyle.**

2. Doesn’t encourage the user to return to the app - often times they introduce all the possible actions at once with paragraphs of detail, making it stressful for those who find environmentalism a “high commitment” activity to consider taking action. **I focused on gamifying actions as well as reducing the scope for a more clearcut intention behind the app.**

<Row content1="<img src = '/startups/gif1.gif' />" 
content2="<h3>Start of the week</h3><p>The day before each week starts (a week is not day specific but a 7 day cycle), the user is introduced to their “Goal of the Week” and some education on why that goal matters.</p><p>I provide an option to add all the goals from previous weeks to encourage continual practice of goals.

Because the user could open their app at any point in the day to set their goals for the week, the weekly tracking doesn’t start until the next day.</p>"
/>

<Row content1="<img src = '/startups/gif2.gif' />" 
content2="<h3>During the week</h3><p>At any time after the weekly new goal onboarding is over, they can view their stats to see their current and all time progress. By quantifying how much actions can impact how much carbon is diverted, it provides a basis for why these individual actions matter.</p><p>I provide additional “challenges” to reward users for continuous app usage, completing their daily goals, and bringing in more goals from previous weeks.</p><p>I also allow users to look at previous goals to review past lessons and content.</p>"
/>

<Row content1="<img src = '/startups/gif3.gif' />" 
content2="<h3>Each day</h3><p>In this flow, I show how at the end of each day users get notifications prompting to see if they completed their daily tasks.</p>"
/>

<Row content1="<img src = '/startups/gif4.gif' />" 
content2="<h3>Each week</h3><p>They are also able to mark off their weekly tasks at any time and undo if it’s a misclick. These tasks are classified as weekly as it would not make sense to have a daily notification for them.</p>"

Won third place at Rough Draft Ventures (General Catalyst) Hackathon after 5 hours of prototyping! Did subsequent iterations on the visual language, interaction design, and mechanics on my own post hackathon. Not freelance but a personal passion project, [learn more here](https://connieliu.notion.site/Green-App-Concept-157dedc3fa3480cabe59fd46314b5d26?pvs=4).

Iâ€™ve also gotten the chance to work at several smaller startups (seed to Series A) and nonprofits usually doing part-time advising and short contained sprints.

## Sway 

Neo-backed startup to increase voting civic engagement through social networks. Came in for a week long sprint to redesign the Amplify feature (user engagement and boosting of a Sway page) for Andrew Yang's launch of the platform.

## Students for Abundance

2 week sprint to design and brand a new marketing page for the first student network of the Abundance movement a bipartisan effort to build social progress. Below are some wide explorations of what this could look like for the first directional sprint.

Below is a peek into the final design and select spot illustrations. Due to limited time, we had to go with the simplest format for Framer implementation (live website [here](https://studentsforabundance.org/)), so a bulk of the effort was spent refining the illustration style and art directing it with a mix of AI-image gen and traditional drawing.

## Agents Startup (Stealth)

Helped them rethink their agent experience given the rise in MCPs and increased tooling (1 day sprint).

## Reward Reports (2023)

The [Reward Reports](https://rewardreports.github.io/) project was started for documentation of changes in AI systems for a Cornell Lab. You can view the research report with some examples of Reward Reports [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10817) with some examples of their structure.

## Simple Healthkit (2022)

Series A startup focused on cheap rapid testing for healthcare funded by Kleiner Perkins. Designed the MVP test kit registration experience with another designer which was presented to clients.

## Mintlify (2023)

Seed-stage startup focused on documentation (2M, funded by Bain Capital Ventures). Set up the design system (complete with variants and modularly setup with nested base components) using Storybook and the current product as a guide. During the time I freelanced there was no designer working there.

## Dreambound (2023)

Seed stage startup focused on matching students to vocational training programs. Set up the design system using Storybook as a guide with modular base components (example below). Worked on designing various usability improvements and other UI design work. During the time I freelanced there was no designer working there.

## abillion (2020)

One of the first places I ever worked at doing UX design (raised 10M series A after I left)! There was barely a design system and everything was in Adobe XD. I shipped the reporting system and worked on a speculative product proposal centered around vegan communities leading design synthesis or 50+ survey responses and 8 interviews. Fun fact they were based in Singapore so I worked night hours when I was there during the pandemic.

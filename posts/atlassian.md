## Overview

At Atlassian my work spans two teams on admin tools and our analytics dashboard. 

For our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) I am working on AI-enabled tools to boost the approachability and productivity of our users who create and view dashboards. Dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. 

On the admin side, I am working closely with product to design and ship a search experience and product strategy to boost the productivity of thousands of Atlassian administrators. I am also working on a strategy to consolidate email notifications and design pattern definitions for the admin design system through auditing and critique.

My work is currently under NDA as it has not been shipped yet, but please [email me](mailto:cliu55567@gmail.com) for more information and if you're curious about my work!

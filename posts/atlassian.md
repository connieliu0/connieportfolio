## Overview

At Atlassian my work spans two teams on admin tools and our analytics dashboard. 

Our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) is an add on for enterprise customers and consists of dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. 


Designed a tool to prompt AI generated SQLite formulas for [data querying](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Atlassian-Analytics-articles/Write-custom-formulas-using-Atlassian-Intelligence/ba-p/2817872).


Designing custom templates to make it easier for customers to share specific dashboards cross-company.

On the admin side, I am working closely with product to design and ship a search experience and product strategy to boost the productivity of thousands of Atlassian administrators. I am also working on a strategy to consolidate email notifications and design pattern definitions for the admin design system through auditing and critique.

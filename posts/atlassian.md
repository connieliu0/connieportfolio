## Overview

At Atlassian my work spans two teams on admin tools and our analytics dashboard. 

For our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) I am working on AI-enabled tools to boost the approachability and productivity of our users who create and view dashboards. Dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. 

On the admin side, I am working closely with product to design and ship a search experience and product strategy to boost the productivity of thousands of Atlassian administrators. I am also working on a strategy to consolidate email notifications and design pattern definitions for the admin design system through auditing and critique.

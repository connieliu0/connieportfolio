## Overview

Currently closely working with product to design and ship a search experience and product strategy to boost the productivity of thousands of Atlassian administrators. Also am working on strategy to consolidate email notifications. In addition, I work on defining design patterns for the admin design system through auditing and critique.

My work is currently under NDA as it has not been shipped yet, but please [email me](mailto:cliu55567@gmail.com) for more information and if you're curious about my work!

## Overview

At Atlassian my work spans two teams on admin tools and our analytics dashboard. 

Our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) is an add on for enterprise customers and consists of dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. Some features I designed: 

- Designed a tool to prompt AI-generated SQLite custom formulas for [data querying](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Atlassian-Analytics-articles/Write-custom-formulas-using-Atlassian-Intelligence/ba-p/2817872) that is 10% more accurate than the standard solution and led to increased creation of custom formulas. 
- Designing custom templates to make it easier for customers to share dashboard configurations cross-company.
- Designing subscriptions - a way to keep up to date with dashboard updates.
  
On the admin side, I am working closely with product to:

- Design and ship a search experience and product strategy to boost the productivity of thousands of Atlassian administrators.
- Solidify design patterns for empty states and table actions
- Growth strategies with Atlassian administration and email notification strategies

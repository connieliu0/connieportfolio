While at Scale I was on three product teams where I worked on **11 projects** from 0-1 features to design systems. I had a range of duties in each cross-functional team, from working with product managers to plan user research to handing off designs to engineers and ensuring designs were implemented correctly.

**Impact Metrics**: My projects on Rapid led to a 70.5% increase in number of template self-serve projects, and a 10% increase in self-serve deployment.

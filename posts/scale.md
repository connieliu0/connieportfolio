While at Scale I was on three product teams (one of which is confidential) where I worked on **11 projects** ranging in scope from design systems to visual alignment redesigns. In each team I did the whole product development process - from working with product managers to plan user research if necessary to handing off designs to engineers and doing visual QA.

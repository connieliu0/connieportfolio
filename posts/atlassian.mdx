## Atlassian Analytics 

Our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) is an add on for enterprise customers and consists of dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. Some features I designed: 


<Row content1="<h2>AI-gen SQLite Custom Formulas ‚ú®</h2><em><h3><a href='https://read.cv/connieliu/ai-customformula'>Case study</a> (password in resume!)</h3></em><p>Led to 10% increase in accuracy, AI-generated custom formulas represented 20% of total created, and increased overall custom formula creation.</p>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/AI_formula.gif' />"
/>

<Row content1="<h2>Custom dashboard templates üìä </h2> <em><h3><a href='https://read.cv/connieliu/custom-template'>Case study</a> (password in resume!)</h3></em><p>Making it easier to reuse company-specific dashboards to increase overall dashboard MAU.</p>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/customtemp.png' />"
/>

  
## Atlassian Admin Experience

Admin.atlassian.com is the hub for thousands of organizations to manager their users and product instances. I designed:

<Row content1="<h2>A search experience and vision to boost the productivity of thousands of Atlassian administrators üîç</h2><em><h3><a href='https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Atlassian-Platform-articles/Introducing-Atlassian-Administration-Search-Find-Settings-Faster/ba-p/2778798'>Announcement</a></h3></em>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/search.gif'  autoplay loop />"
/>

<Row content1="<h2>Design patterns for empty states and table actions and email notifications üñäÔ∏è</h2>" 
content2="<img src = '/atlassian/actions.png' />"
/>

## Miscellaneous

Outside of designing projects, I contributed possitively to team culture by hosting an in-person workshop where we implemented workflow improvements such as project-specific slack channels, which received many Kudos from engineers.

I also worked on generative research to investigate user's receptions to Chart and Dashboard Insights which received recognition from Head of Product and impacted the Rovo AI team's roadmap.

Beyond that, I mentored a new grad designer and participated in Atlassian's mentorship program to improve my prototyping skills.

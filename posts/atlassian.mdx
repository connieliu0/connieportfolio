## 📈 Atlassian Analytics 

Our analytics product (Atlassian Analytics) is an add on for enterprise customers and consists of dashboards are mainly used to monitor company productivity at a high level - from pull requests to revenue. Some features I designed: 
<Row content1="<h3>AI-gen SQLite Custom Formulas ✨</h3><em><h4><a href='https://read.cv/connieliu/ai-customformula'>Case study</a> (password in resume!)</h4></em><p>Led to 11% increase in accuracy, AI-generated represented 23% of all custom formulas created, and increased overall custom formula creation.</p>"

### Crossfunctional Workshops and Generative AI Research

Outside of designing projects, I contributed possitively to team culture by hosting an in-person workshop where we implemented workflow improvements such as project-specific slack channels, which received many Kudos from engineers.

I also worked on **generative AI research** to investigate user's receptions to Chart and Dashboard Insights which received recognition from Head of Product and impacted the Rovo AI team's roadmap.

Beyond that, I mentored a new grad designer and participated in Atlassian's mentorship program to improve my prototyping skills.

## 👤 Atlassian Admin Experience

Admin.atlassian.com is the hub for thousands of organizations to manager their users and product instances. I designed:
<Row content1="<h3>A search experience and vision for thousands of administrators 🔍</h3><em><h4><a href='https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Atlassian-Platform-articles/Introducing-Atlassian-Administration-Search-Find-Settings-Faster/ba-p/2778798'>Announcement</a></h4></em><p>Designed feature that doubled the rate of successful searches.</p>"

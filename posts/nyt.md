# Constraints and Learnings

Due to its proximity to traditional news management, the team I was on at NYT was extremely limited in giving designers agency. Here is how I navigated around constraints:

1. **A low-bandwidth PM who was managing four teams** - I navigated around this by asking other team members on analogous CMS products about their design process to reduce the number of iterations. Also I juggled two projects so I could work on one while waiting for the PM to answer my questions async.

2. **Restricted user interaction** - Because our users were busy journalists, it was difficult to get feedback even for an internal tool. I relied on documentation from prior research sprints to get up to date with user problems and prepared for weekly 10 minute calls with product onboarding liasons who served as a proxy.

3. **Lack of documentation** - To better understand the design workflow, I asked designers what got most stakeholder buyin. Due to the team's low engineering bandwidth I learned feasibility was emphasized, I used this as a north star in proposing my ideas which were eventually sent to production.

# Work Overview

At this time my work is under **NDA** as it falls under internal tools. Over my time at NYT:

1. **Shipped** "Hold for Order" (work for a specific event that will happen in the future) label integration to the Live Admin CMS (Content Management System).

2. **Shipped** four workflow improvements to Pilot to ensure bursts (example below) are published in a readable manner utilizing NYT's Ink design system.

3. **Prototyped** MVP of live video minimization micro-interaction with feasibility input from lead engineer and manager of 16 person working group.

4. **Proposed** PM - designer organizational communication improvements to give designers more product agency

5. Worked on 4 maker week projects (week long hackathon), **won best UI** for octopus illustrations for Kids App.

In summary, I learned a lot about how to navigate a resource-constrained environment and for advocating my value as a designer. I look forward to my next adventures in design!

I’ve also gotten the chance to work at several smaller startups as well as do other design work. Below is a preview of my work for each.

# Mintlify (2023)

Seed-stage startup focused on documentation (2M, funded by Bain Capital Ventures). Setting up the design system and brand design. View the design system file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Jtxm8hPNLhKMtdJpaqVtKs/Mint-Design-System?node-id=14%3A127&t=Sr2OBdYQklDhfssa-1).

# Simple Healthkit (2022)

Seed-stage startup focused on cheap rapid testing for healthcare (funded by Kleiner Perkins. Designed the MVP which was presented to clients.

# RDV Green (2022)

Won third place at Rough Draft Ventures (General Catalyst) Hackathon after 5 hours of prototyping!

Sustainability tracking is an overdone idea - and I wanted to avoid the key pitfalls I saw in EarthHero, Joro, and Capture:

![Green](startups/green.png)

1. Too much energy on quantifying the carbon footprint of existing - instead of measuring the current harm, **instead I wanted to focus on actionable goals towards a generalist sustainable lifestyle.**

- Especially since some actions may be outside of a user’s hands (aka their commute or energy provider)

2. Doesn’t encourage the user to return to the app - often times they introduce all the possible actions at once with paragraphs of detail, making it stressful for those who find environmentalism a “high commitment” activity to consider taking action. **I focused on gamifying actions as well as reducing the scope for a more clearcut intention behind the app.**

# abillion (2020)

The first startup I worked at (raised 10M series A after internship)! I shipped the reporting system and worked on a speculative product proposal centered around vegan communities leading design synthesis or 50+ survey responses and 8 interviews.

# NIH (2020)

For the Fall of 2020 I was selected to be part of the 37 person [Civic Digital Fellowship](https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship) cohort (10% acceptance rate). The fellowship is a paid internship for student technologists to solve pressing problems in federal agencies and foray into civic tech.

For my project, I was tasked with creating an education section geared towards the public for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering's Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group Wiki.

I’ve also gotten the chance to work at several smaller startups (seed to Series A) and miscellaneous places like the NIH and a Cornell Tech Research group.

# Reward Reports (2023)

The [Reward Reports](https://rewardreports.github.io/) project was started for documentation of changes in AI systems. You can view the research report with some examples of Reward Reports [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10817) with some examples of their structure.

# Simple Healthkit (2022)

Series A startup focused on cheap rapid testing for healthcare funded by Kleiner Perkins. Designed the MVP test kit registration experience with another designer which was presented to clients.

# Mintlify (2023)

Seed-stage startup focused on documentation (2M, funded by Bain Capital Ventures). Set up the design system (complete with variants and modularly setup with nested base components) using Storybook and the current product as a guide. During the time I freelanced there was no designer working there.

# Dreambound (2023)

Seed stage startup focused on matching students to vocational training programs. Set up the design system using Storybook as a guide with modular base components (example below). Worked on designing various usability improvements and other UI design work. During the time I freelanced there was no designer working there.

# Green App (2022)

Won third place at Rough Draft Ventures (General Catalyst) Hackathon after 5 hours of prototyping! Did subsequent iterations on the visual language, interaction design, and mechanics on my own post hackathon. Not freelance but a personal passion project, [view the prototype in action](https://connieliu.notion.site/Green-App-Concept-157dedc3fa3480cabe59fd46314b5d26?pvs=4).

Sustainability tracking is an overdone idea - and I wanted to avoid the key pitfalls I saw in EarthHero, Joro, and Capture:

1. Too much energy on quantifying the carbon footprint of existing - instead of measuring the current harm, **instead I wanted to focus on actionable goals and clear education towards a generalist sustainable lifestyle.**

2. Doesn’t encourage the user to return to the app - often times they introduce all the possible actions at once with paragraphs of detail, making it stressful for those who find environmentalism a “high commitment” activity to consider taking action. **I focused on gamifying actions as well as reducing the scope for a more clearcut intention behind the app.**

# abillion (2020)

One of the first places I ever worked at doing UX design (raised 10M series A after I left)! There was barely a design system and everything was in Adobe XD. I shipped the reporting system and worked on a speculative product proposal centered around vegan communities leading design synthesis or 50+ survey responses and 8 interviews.
